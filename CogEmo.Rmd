# The Relationship of Emotion to Cognition: A Functional Approach to a Semantic Controversy. (1987) Leventhal, H. & Scherer, K. 

@leventhal1987relationship first details the on-going debate (circa 1980s) regarding whether or not emotion can precede cognition (and is therefore independent of it) (which is the position of Zajonc), or whether that it is "secondary and largely dependent on cognition" (based on @lazarus1966psychological) (p. 3). The authors fo the paper believe this debate is mostly pointless for it becomes lost in a  labyrinth of defining the terms cognition and emotion. For instance, can emotion be defined as a purely automatic response that doesn't require cognition, e.g. an "escape reaction" (@zajonc1980feeling qtd. p. 5)? Or is something like an escape reaction not an emotion and merely a stimulus, and it takes cognition to "analyze" the stimulus and then the emotion (or in this case escape reaction) is activated/felt? It depends again on how one defines stimulus, emotion and cognition. The paper offers a different tripartite componential model in which, at it's most basic level, the sensory-motor level, emotion may be felt sans cognition, but beyond that thet posit that a "schematical" and then a "conceptual"" level is engaged. One last point about "time" in their model is important: They suggest that "while we may characterize a stimulus, e.g. a live snake, as 'emotional' because it is a relative activator of autonomic or expressive behavior, its activation of the cognitive or perceptual components of the schema is likely to be so nearly simultaneous with the activation of the expressive and autonomic component, as to negate the significance of @zajonc1980feeling's suggestion that emotional mechanism operate prior to and independent to cognitive mechanisms" (p. 12-3). And again, "the arousal of a schema, whether by an external or internal stimulus or a shift in level of a hormone or neurotransmitter, implies the simultaneous activation of cognitive (situation) and emotion (expressive, subjective feeling) components.." p. 24.) 

# An Appraisal-Driven Componential Approach to the Emotional Brain. (2018) Sander D.; Gradjean, D.; and Scherer, K.R. 

@sander2018appraisal's paper, like @leventhal1987relationship, is attemping to combine or evolve beyond two different approaches to affective neuroscience. It is, in many ways, a more thorough explication of how emotions are produced. They claim that in all the conflicting research there is at least "consensus with respect to the notion that an emotion is not a unitary entity but rather a multicomponent phenomenon (p. 220-1). The authors suggest "five functionally defined neural networks" (p. 219) that give rise to emotion through a "two-step, fast-process" (p. 222). The five networks (Elicitation Network, Expressive Network, Autonomic Reaction Network, the Action Tendency Network, and the Feeling Network) are each individually being studied; however, "brain resaerch has been concerned with each of these components, it has rarely been developed in the context of of an integrated appraoch to emotion" (p. 228). They are thus calling for such an integration. Lastly, they posit the "appraising brain" (within the Elicitation Network) - that is, a brain that is keying in on events (internal and external) that are highly relevant to the individual's eliciting of an emotion. In sum, the appraising brain seems to echo @leventhal1987relationship suggest that emotion and cognition are very much interconnecting, as an event "activates" the Elicitation Network and the appraising brain, which synchornizes the expression of the emotion, the feeling of the emotion, and so forth. Where and when does the emotion start? The answer is within several networks almost all at once.
